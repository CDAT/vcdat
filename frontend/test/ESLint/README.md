# ESLint

[ESLint][1] is a [Javascript linting tool][2] . It assesses our code to ensure that it both conforms to
our specified code style, and is free of typical Javascript developer faux pas. This helps us to maintain code quality
by preventing certain types of bugs before they happen, and by keeping the code clean and easy on the eyes of our dev
team.
